# Using Nokogiri to Scrape Websites AND Fetching Data From APIS

## What is Scraping?
  - Using HTML tags, ids, and CSS names to select specific objects

## Techniques for Scraping
  - Determine your models, then look at the page to see what information you need
  - Break down the website into pieces you want information from
    â€“ DO NOT go for individuals details, go for elements that CONTAIN all the details that you need to make an instance
    - We want to select elements that help us make one instance at a time (of whatever class we've decided to make)
    - When we want to find something by a class name, the css selector requires a '.' before the name of the class
    - For IDs, it requires a "#"
  - Find a common selector attribute between all of them (usually a class name), and use it to select all of them
  - Iterate over all collected objects and pull the information that you want, using another attribute selector
